## File Structure
    
I am following the below type of file structure for organizing your code:
    
```
src/
|-- pages/
|   |-- Home/
|   |   |-- index.js
|   |   |-- Home.js
|   |   |-- Home.module.css
|   |   |-- components/
|   |       |-- Component1.js
|   |       |-- Component1.module.css
|   |       |-- Component2.js
|   |       |-- Component2.module.css
|   |-- About/
|   |   |-- index.js
|   |   |-- About.js
|   |   |-- About.module.css
|   |   |-- components/
|   |       |-- Component1.js
|   |       |-- Component1.module.css
|   |       |-- Component2.js
|   |       |-- Component2.module.css
|   |-- AppRoutes.js
|-- styles/
|   |-- global.css
|-- App.js
|-- index.js
```

 This file structure organizes your code into pages for different sections of the website, with each page having its own directory containing its main component (index.js, PageName.js, PageName.module.css) and a components directory for additional components specific to that page. Additionally, there's an AppRoutes.js file for managing routes, a styles directory for global styles, and the main App.js and index.js files
 
## Usage

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the Professor's website.

## Additional Configuration

- **Customization**: Feel free to customize the content, styling, and functionality of the website according to your preferences. Update the components, stylesheets, and data files as needed.

- **Deployment**: When you're ready to deploy the website to a live server, you can use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for hosting.

- **Data Management**: If you need to manage dynamic data such as publications or research interests, consider using a backend server (e.g., Node.js with Express) and a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store and retrieve data.

## Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```

This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed! See the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for more information.

## Ejecting

To eject from the default build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, use the following command:

```
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own. You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

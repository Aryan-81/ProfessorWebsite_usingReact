// You're correct in pointing out that it may seem redundant to have both index.js and Home.js if all the code from Home.js is moved to index.js. However, the purpose of having an index.js file within each directory is mainly for convenience and organization, especially in larger projects.

// Here are some reasons for having an index.js file:

// Organization: By having an index.js file, you keep the directory structure consistent across different pages or components. This makes it easier to navigate and understand the project's structure, especially when working with multiple files and directories.

// Exporting: The index.js file acts as an entry point for the directory. It can export all the components or functionality within that directory. This makes it easier to import the directory's content without needing to specify the exact file name.

// Encapsulation: It helps encapsulate the internal structure of the directory. Other parts of the application only need to know about the directory itself, not the specific files it contains.

// Simplifying Imports: When importing components from the directory, you can use a simplified import statement without needing to specify the file name. For example, import Home from './Home'; instead of import Home from './Home/Home';.

// While in the case of a simple Home component, it may seem unnecessary to have both index.js and Home.js, it becomes more beneficial as the directory grows and includes multiple components, utilities, or other files. Additionally, adhering to this convention helps maintain consistency across the project, making it easier for other developers to understand the structure.
